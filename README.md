# UWBlueprint Starter-Code
The starter code for UWBlueprint projects! Made with love by the project-infra team!

## Introduction
We are UW Blueprint, a student-run organization at the University of Waterloo. We 
build technology for non-profit organizations free of charge! We've found that it 
takes several weeks for each team to setup the boilerplate code for their projects 
and that projects independently converge to very similar tech stacks. To solve 
this issue, we've created the starter-code project! The starter-code project allows 
teams to setup, develop, and deploy projects faster which allows UW Blueprint to 
better serve our non-profit partners.

## The Tech Stack
These technologies are proven, popular, easy to learn, and provide fast development speeds.
- React + Redux
- Python + Flask
- PostgreSQL
- Firebase

## Example Project
The starter-code project shows how to build on top of the boilerplate code using 
the following scenario:
### Recycling Race!!!
A local elementary school is running a recycling race between all of the classes! 
Each class is fiercely competing to recycle the most items! They’ve asked UW 
Blueprint to build an app that can help keep track of each class’ recycling progress.
